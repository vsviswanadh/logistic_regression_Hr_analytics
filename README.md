# HR Analytics Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Human Resources (HR) data to understand employee behavior and predict potential employee turnover. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Dataset
HR_comma_sep.csv
Contains HR-related data such as:

Satisfaction level

Last evaluation

Number of projects

Average monthly hours

Time spent at the company

Work accident

Promotion in the last 5 years

Department

Salary

Left (Target Variable)

Notebook Content
The notebook (notebook.ipynb) covers:

Data Loading and Exploration
Using Pandas and Seaborn for initial exploration and understanding patterns.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling null values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing correlations, satisfaction trends, and turnover patterns.

Model Building
Using machine learning algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model Evaluation
Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Ensure Python and required libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Place HR_comma_sep.csv in the same directory as notebook.ipynb.

Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.

Insights and Outcomes
Identified key factors influencing employee turnover.

Built predictive models to help HR departments anticipate potential resignations.
